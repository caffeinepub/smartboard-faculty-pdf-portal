Audit the `PDFUploadForm` component (`frontend/src/components/PDFUploadForm.tsx`) and the `useUploadPDF` mutation hook in `frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts` to identify why the assignment fails: (1) verify the faculty selector inside the form correctly populates the list of active faculty members from the backend; (2) ensure the selected faculty IDs are collected and passed correctly to the backend `uploadPDF` call; (3) ensure no pre-flight admin credential re-check short-circuits the submission before the backend is contacted; (4) ensure the backend `uploadPDF` function in `backend/main.mo` accepts the faculty assignment parameter and persists the assignment without requiring a secondary authorization token — the sessionStorage flag set by AdminPasscodeGate is the sole auth signal; (5) after a successful upload, invalidate and refetch the PDF list query so the table reflects the newly assigned PDF immediately.",
