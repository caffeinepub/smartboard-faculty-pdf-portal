  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements (REQ-43, REQ-44, REQ-45) with good coverage. Backend adds adminCredentials stable state with default credentials and both verifyAdminCredentials/setAdminCredentials functions. Frontend replaces the passcode gate with a username+password form, adds sessionStorage persistence, shows credentials on HomePage, and adds a ChangeAdminCredentialsForm. All major acceptance criteria appear to be satisfied based on the diff evidence.",
